## Text
The method for 'style transfer' implemented in this repo is actually something closer to 'style alignment' - it involves determining an unsupervised alignment between word embedding spaces for two different styles, then performing a mapping on text to transform the one into the other. Currently nothing fancier than just translating word by word, which is obviously not a proper translation, but that's where it's at.
